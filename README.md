Currently, I'm developing products with **Flutter** and **Dart** for mobile and **C#** and **.NET** for the back-end. Additionally, I'm learning **TypeScript** and **Next.js** for web development.
I have experience creating **CI/CD pipelines** to **submit application versions** to app stores using **Azure** and **GitHub Actions**.
